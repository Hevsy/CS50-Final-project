# Travel Companion
Final Project for CS50x Course

A web app for storing travel plans and activities

The first deceison to be made - Flask or Django?
Flask is already familiar from PSet9 and is rather straightforward.
Django seems to be a more powerfull framework, however takes significant time to lern. Therefore, I start with Flask.
